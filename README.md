# K_means_algorithm
K-means custering algorithm, expanded to K means++ algorithm using C-api.
The first part of the code is the K-means algorithm implemented in both C and Python.
The K-means++ algorithm was initialized in python, while the main part is written in C and executed through the Python/C API. The code is written for Linux environment.
